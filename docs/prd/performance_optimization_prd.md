# Performance Optimization PRD - Mocky App

## Executive Summary

The Mocky app is experiencing significant performance degradation in three critical areas:
1. **Mock endpoint creation** - Heavy schema processing and API calls
2. **Navigation** - Slow route transitions and component loading
3. **Schema designer field management** - Excessive re-renders and state cloning

## Current Performance Pain Points

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Immediate Impact)

#### 1. Schema Designer Field Operations
**Problem**: Adding/editing fields causes 2-5 second lag
- **Root Cause**: `structuredClone()` on every field update for complex schemas
- **Impact**: Unusable UX for schemas with 10+ fields
- **Location**: `src/components/schema-designer.tsx` lines 630-660

#### 2. Mock Generation Processing
**Problem**: Creating endpoints with nested schemas takes 3-8 seconds
- **Root Cause**: Recursive field generation without optimization
- **Impact**: Poor user experience during endpoint creation
- **Location**: `src/lib/mock-generator.ts` lines 4-35

#### 3. Recursive Component Re-renders
**Problem**: Entire field tree re-renders on any single field change
- **Root Cause**: Non-memoized callbacks and shared state references
- **Impact**: Exponential performance degradation with nesting depth
- **Location**: `src/components/schema-designer.tsx` RecursiveField component

### ðŸŸ¡ Important Issues (Noticeable Impact)

#### 4. Navigation Lag
**Problem**: 1-2 second delay when navigating between pages
- **Root Cause**: Heavy component hydration and lack of code splitting
- **Impact**: Poor perceived performance
- **Location**: Route components in `src/app/`

#### 5. API Request Inefficiency
**Problem**: Large payload sizes and no request debouncing
- **Root Cause**: Complete schema objects sent with every update
- **Impact**: Network congestion and server load
- **Location**: `src/app/create/page.tsx` and API routes

#### 6. State Management Overhead
**Problem**: Complex state objects being fully cloned for small changes
- **Root Cause**: Immutability patterns without optimization
- **Impact**: Memory pressure and GC pauses
- **Location**: Schema state management throughout app

### ðŸŸ¢ Nice-to-have Optimizations

#### 7. Bundle Size Optimization
**Problem**: Large initial bundle size
- **Root Cause**: Heavy dependencies and lack of tree shaking
- **Impact**: Slower initial page loads

#### 8. Memory Leaks
**Problem**: Potential memory accumulation with complex schemas
- **Root Cause**: Unreleased references and listeners
- **Impact**: Degraded performance over time

## Performance Targets

### Current State
- **Schema Field Addition**: 2-5 seconds
- **Mock Generation**: 3-8 seconds  
- **Navigation**: 1-2 seconds
- **Initial Page Load**: 3-4 seconds

### Target State
- **Schema Field Addition**: <200ms
- **Mock Generation**: <500ms
- **Navigation**: <300ms
- **Initial Page Load**: <1.5 seconds

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Reduce from 4s to <1.5s
- **Field Addition Latency**: Reduce from 3s to <200ms
- **Mock Generation Time**: Reduce from 5s to <500ms

### Secondary Metrics
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: <1.2s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: <0.1
- **Bundle Size**: Reduce by 30%
- **Memory Usage**: Reduce by 40%

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Constraints
- **Browser Support**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
- **Memory Limit**: <100MB for complex schemas
- **Network**: Work efficiently on 3G connections
- **CPU**: Smooth performance on mid-range devices

### Compatibility Requirements
- Maintain existing API contracts
- Preserve all current functionality
- No breaking changes to user workflows
- Backward compatibility with existing schemas

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1-2)
1. Optimize schema state management
2. Implement field operation debouncing
3. Replace structuredClone with optimized updates

### Phase 2: Important Improvements (Week 3-4)
1. Add component virtualization
2. Implement proper memoization
3. Optimize mock generation algorithms

### Phase 3: Nice-to-have Optimizations (Week 5-6)

2. Advanced caching strategies
3. Memory leak prevention

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Schema corruption** during optimization
- **Breaking changes** to existing endpoints
- **User workflow disruption**

### Medium Risk
- **Increased complexity** in state management
- **Testing overhead** for performance changes
- **Browser compatibility** issues

### Low Risk
- **Bundle size increases** from optimization libraries
- **Development velocity** impact during transition
